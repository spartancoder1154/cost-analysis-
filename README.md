Medical Data Analysis
This project demonstrates basic data wrangling and analysis using Python. It processes a single string of messy medical data and extracts structured information, such as names, ages, BMI, and insurance costs. The script showcases key data cleaning techniques and simple statistical analysis to provide meaningful insights from raw input.
